<h2>About</h2><p>PolitiCrowd’s mission is to reduce the influence of money and special interests in politics by facilitating democratic and transparent communication between people and their elected officials. OpenLetters are the medium through which users will be able to crowdsource their influence by upvoting user contributions and the letter itself. They can request a response from their politicians on every letter they upvote. We automatically notify politicians once a threshold of requests is met and update users of any response(s) issued if they follow the OpenLetter or politicians on their ‘My Politics’ page. Our aim is that politicians increasingly come to recognize individuals as the political stakeholders in their communities, not special interest groups. We want to give voice to those without access to lobbying funds so they can participate outside the voting booth. The OpenLetters platform provides individuals with an environment for collective political influence powered by votes.
</p><br/><h2>Alternative to existing methods of influence</h2>
<p>A popular way to influence politicians is to sign a petition, write an email, or add content to a form letter drafted by an advocacy group. Though petitions aggregate signatures, they only present one perspective, and websites such as Change.org are not yet set up to track responses from politicians. The endless flow of emails from the latter two methods of influence leave politicians and their staff unable to precisely filter emails and forced to send generic responses. This environment fuels apathy among the voting population, which is alienated from their elected officials unless they make a considerable effort to engage. Unlike existing methods, an OpenLetter provides an aggregated and pre-filtered list of the best user contributions to the letter, ranked by number of unique upvotes. Since upvotes are grouped by voting district, one letter can target many politicians and take on a different meaning based on how a particular district voted on the contributions to the letter. 
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Financing</h2>
<p>PolitiCrowd was created in reaction to the Citizen’s United Supreme Court decision that opened the floodgates to campaign contributions, a billion dollar industry. We believe all people should participate in our democracy without needing deep pockets or a significant amount of time. We will never charge users or politicians to create and participate fully in OpenLetters. In addition to relying on grants and donations, we will offer certain paid services such as trend analysis and statistical breakdowns based on local and national trends. Most importantly, we are a nonprofit and our core values are those of openness and transparency; any sort of revenue-raising activity will be straightforwardly communicated to our users.
</p><br/><h2>Looking forward</h2>
<p>PolitiCrowd’s strategy is to build our user base locally. Just as we are trying to grow our users' political influence, we must grow from the ground up. We are launching locally in Portland, Oregon, where we have local knowledge, experience, and connections. We will listen to our users and gradually expand to other cities and states, while ensuring a high quality, reliable user experience. By building a strong local base, we expect the crowdsourcing effect to organically grow our product while maintaining the integrity which causes users to adopt it in the first place.
